# LearningDeep

This repository contains some small projects that use deep learning for some classification problems. This is mainly meant for me to learn how frameworks like `pytortch` work, and how all techniques around deep learning work.

Feel free to use all code as example code. This repository probably also contains code that's copied from other tutorials. If this is the case I'll make sure to comment the link of the tutorial in the source files.

### TODO
- [ ] Make a GAN that handles the XOR problem.
- [ ] Make a neural network that can classify images of hand-written digits as digits.
- [ ] Look at how we can input audio into a neural network.
